This collection of program files and data were used to calculate the Continued 
Fraction Expansion coefficients for Champernowne's Constant in Base 10. Various programs were written
in Ruby and C (MS VC++ with MPIR and Linux with GMP). The method
and results are described in the paper "On the High Water Mark Convergents of Champernowne's Constant
in Base Ten", http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1263.

The calculation method, programs, and data have been updated and generalized to various bases and the
results are described in the paper "Analysis of the High Water Mark Convergents of Champernowne's 
Constant in Various Bases", http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0261.

The updated programs and data may be accessed at 
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2oQudZQvHfSZ1hZN2VIYmU5eTQ&usp=sharing.
The readme files should be helpful for building and running the programs with MS VC++ and MPIR,
and GMP on Linux. USE OF THESE FILES IS RECOMMENDED RATHER THAN THE FILES IN THE CURRENT LOCATION 
(GMP function call error checking has been added, etc.).

The updated programs and data do not include the base 10 (or any other base) 2nd Generation HWM data
(see the acticles). If a user is interested in this data, it must be downloaded from the current location.
